# LinuxNetScanner

A simple network scanner project.
For now, this simple script is running only in linux systems.

In a long long future i may launch it to windows.


Well, this works with the simple idea of pinging the ip range that you pass as parameter. If the code receives the response, it will store the ip on a variable and plain text file, which is easier for python to read and write.


Feel free to submit changing ideas, tips, adjustments, etc.


I'm here for what you need.
